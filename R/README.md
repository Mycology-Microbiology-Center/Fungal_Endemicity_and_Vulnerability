### Precipitation transformation (negative of inverse hyperbolic sine)

In general, power transformations are recommended for the analysis of precipitation data (e.g., Wilks DS, Statistical methods in the atmospheric sciences, 2006). Precipitation data are usually left-skewed, and the ecological rationale for transformation is that the meaning of the precipitation amount changes across the gradient (*i.e.*, the environmental effect of a 50 mm difference in monthly precipitation is very different in arid and tropical areas). As `log(0)` is undefined, the logarithmic transformation does not allow retaining zero-valued observations, which are common in extremely dry areas. The inverse hyperbolic sine (`arcsinh`) transformation behaves similarly to a log transformation; it is easy to implement and does not require the addition of an arbitrary constant (*e.g.*, `log(x+1)`). Taking the negative of `arcsinh`-transformed values was needed to estimate the vulnerability index for precipitation deficiency (**drought**), as it empathizes the effect of little or no precipitation.

# Superecoregions and endemicity
This directory comprises the R-code to for the delimitation of the biogeographic superecoregions starting from the ecoregions of Olson et al 2001, as well as the code for calculating the endemicity indeces used in [Tederso et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16398). 

# Additional data needed
The input data to run the pipeline are available in a permanent zenodo repository associated with the paper [DOI LINK upon publication]().

# How to reproduce the analyses
The scripts in this directory represent a directional pipeline which should be run consecutively. After copying the input and output folder from the zenodo repository to the working directory, the scripts can be run starting with script 01. If specific steps are required, these are outlined in the comments.
